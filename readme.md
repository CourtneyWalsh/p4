<b>Description</b><br>
My web application is an online bucket list. Users can sign up/log on and maintain an ongoing bucket list. Users start with a list of uncompleted tasks (buckets) and create their own lists of things they would like to do. A completed list of tasks is then kept in the form of their bucket list. Users can add to their list from the library of buckets or create their own as well as edit each bucket.
